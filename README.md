# LibraryCuties

Our final project for first year BSE. Project by Lara, Jakob and Olivia of Yoobee's Wellington campus.

## Yoobee Library System Prerequisites
- Make sure you Qt installed with compatibility for Qt 4.
- We haven't tested if our project can build on MacOS, so if you want to be safe, use at least a win32 operating system.
