# LibraryCuties

Our final project for first year BSE. Project by Lara, Jakob and Olivia of Yoobee's Wellington campus.

### Yoobee Library System Prerequisites
- We haven't tested if our project can build on MacOS, so if you want to be safe, use at least a win32 operating system.

### How to install
- Click the green "Code" button, and click "Download ZIP", install it somewhere on your computer.
- Once the .zip file is installed, extract the contents and then open the "YoobeeLibrarySystemRelease" folder
- Double click on the YoobeeLibrarySystem.exe near the bottom of the file, and it should open a window that looks like this:
