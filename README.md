# LibraryCuties

Our final project for first year BSE. Project by Lara, Jakob and Olivia of Yoobee's Wellington campus.

### Yoobee Library System Prerequisites
- We haven't tested if our project can build on MacOS, so if you want to be safe, use at least a win32 operating system.

### How to install
- Click the green "Code" button, and click "Download ZIP", install it somewhere on your computer.
- Once the .zip file is installed, extract the contents and then open the "YoobeeLibrarySystemRelease" folder
- Double click on the "release" folder
- Scroll to the bottom of the folder to find YoobeeLibrarySystem.exe
- Double click on the the .exe file
- You will have likely been told that windows has protected your PC, this is understandable since we're just students, not a known publisher. Click "More info" and then the "Run anyway" button.
- You should now have opened the Yoobee Library System, and it should look something like this!

From there, you can mess around and use the program however you'd like. 

If you ever run into trouble and somethings not working properly, deleting the "SystemLogs" and "CSVFiles" folders will usually do the trick. When you run the program, the folders will be created again with their default values.
